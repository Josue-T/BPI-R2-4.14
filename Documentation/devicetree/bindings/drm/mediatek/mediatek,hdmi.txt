Mediatek HDMI Encoder
=====================

The Mediatek HDMI encoder can generate HDMI 1.4a or MHL 2.0 signals from
its parallel input.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mediatek,<chip>-hdmi".
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- reg-names: must contain "grl", "cec", and "sys".
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the function block.
- clocks: device clocks
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: must contain "cec", "hdmi_sel", "hdmi_div1", "hdmi_div2",
  "hdmi_div3", "hdmi_pixel", "hdmi_pll", "aud_bclk", and "aud_spdif".
- ddc-i2c-bus: phandle link to the I2C controller used for DDC EDID probing
- phys: phandle link to the HDMI PHY node.
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt for details.
- phy-names: must contain "hdmi"
- ports: A node containing input and output port nodes with endpoint
  definitions as documented in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.
- port@0: The input port in the ports node should be connected to a DPI output
  port.

Optional properties:
- port@1: The output port in the ports node can be connected to the input port
  of an attached bridge chip, such as a SlimPort transmitter.

HDMI DDC
========

The HDMI DDC i2c controller is used to interface with the HDMI DDC pins.
The Mediatek's I2C controller is used to interface with I2C devices.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mediatek,<chip>-hdmi-ddc"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- clocks: device clock
- clock-names: Must contain "ddc-i2c".

HDMI PHY
========

The HDMI PHY serializes the HDMI encoder's three channel 10-bit parallel
output and drives the HDMI pads.

Required properties:
- compatible: "mediatek,<chip>-hdmi-phy"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the module's registers
- #phy-cells: must be <0>.

Optional properties:
- ibias: TX DRV bias current for <1.65Gbps, defaults to 0xa
- ibias_up: TX DRV bias current for >1.65Gbps, defaults to 0x1c
