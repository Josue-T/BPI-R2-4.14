SMI(Smart Multimedia Interface)

The hardware block diagram please check bindings/iommu/mediatek,iommu.txt

Required properties:
- compatible : must be "mediatek,mt8173-smi"
- reg : the register and size of the smi.
- clocks : must contain one entry for each clock-names.
	There are 2 clockes:
	APB clock : Advanced Peripheral Bus clock, It's the clock for setting
		the register.
	SMI clock : It's the clock for transfer data and command.
- clock-name: must be "apb" and "smi".

Example:
	smi_common:smi@14022000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-smi";
		reg = <0 0x14022000 0 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&mmsys MM_SMI_COMMON>,
			 <&mmsys MM_SMI_COMMON>;
		clock-names = "apb", "smi";
	};
