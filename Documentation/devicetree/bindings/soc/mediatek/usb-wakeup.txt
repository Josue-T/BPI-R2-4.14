MediaTek USB Wakeup binding
-----------------------------

The SSUSB-SPM glue layer is used to control some signals of USB
wakeup, such as IP-SLEEP, LINE-STATE, IDDIG etc, which are mutually
exclusive.

Required properties (controller (parent) node):
- compatible: Should be one of:
	- "mediatek,<soc-model>-uwk","mediatek,usb-wk-v1"
		soc-model is the name of SoC, supports one of:
		- mt8173, mt8176
	- "mediatek,<soc-model>-uwk","mediatek,usb-wk-v2"
		soc-model is the name of SoC, supports one of:
		- mt2712

- mediatek,wkc: must contain a syscon phandle, such as pericfg controller
- #address-cells : should be '1'
- #size-cells : should be '1'

Required nodes: a sub-node is required for each glue layer provided for
	each SSUSB IP. Address range information including the usual 'reg'
	property is used inside these nodes to describe the controller's
	topology.

Required properties (glue layer (child) node):
- reg: address and length of the register set within the syscon which is
	assigned to @mediatek,wkc.
- #mediatek,uwk-cells: should be 1 (see the second example), cell after
	glue layer phandle is wakeup type from:
		- MTU_WK_IP_SLEEP
		- MTU_WK_LINE_STATE
	The wakeup types defined in
		- include/dt-bindings/soc/mediatek,usb-wakeup.h


Example:

usb_wakeup: uwk@0 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt2712-uwk","mediatek,usb-wk-v2";
	mediatek,wkc = <&pericfg>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	status = "okay";

	usb_wk0: uwk@510 {
		reg = <0x510 0x4>;
		#mediatek,uwk-cells = <1>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	usb_wk1: uwk@514 {
		reg = <0x514 0x4>;
		#mediatek,uwk-cells = <1>;
		status = "okay";
	};
};


Specifying wakeup control of devices
---------------------------------

Device nodes should specify the configuration required in their
"mediatek,uwks" property, containing a phandle to the glue layer
node and a wakeup type, because each USB controller has just one
glue layer for wakeup, so only one phandle is supported;

Example:

#include <dt-bindings/soc/mediatek,usb-wakeup.h>

usb_host1: xhci@112c0000 {
	...
	mediatek,uwks = <&usb_wk2 MTU_WK_IP_SLEEP>;
	...
};
